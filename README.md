# MarkovChain

## Classroom Transition Matrix Analysis

### 📝 **Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the transition probabilities of classroom states within a building. It models the transitions using Markov Chains and calculates steady-state probabilities based on the initial state distribution.
